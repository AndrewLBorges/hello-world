# hello-world
first repository, just trying it out

Hello again!
I'm Andrew, I really like coding in general, which is why i chose computer science as my career path. Im looking to improve in a broad spectrum of aspects, but I do have a particular taste for IA(even not knowing that much about it just yet).
I also really like strogonoff and pizza.
ps: Im still a complete beginner, so be patient please.
